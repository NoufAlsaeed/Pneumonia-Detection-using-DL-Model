# Bacground 
Pneumonia is an infection that can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. The exploration of x-ray images using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms to detect some diseases, obtained a lot of researchersâ€™ attentions in the medical field, where it has shown promising results. The goal of this paper is to develop a deep learning model to detect pneumonia from chest x-ray images.
